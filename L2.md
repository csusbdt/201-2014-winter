## Instructions

Do the exercises described below; adhere to the folder naming scheme used for the previous lab, changing numbers accordingly.  Commit your work into your source code repository.  Use your browser to verify that your files have been written into it. 

## Exercise 1:  Practice with mathematical expressions (10 points)

Write a console program that prompts the user for 3 double precision floating point values x, y and z.  Have the program compute and display the following values.

- the sum of x, y and z
- the sine of x
- the cosine of x plus y divided by z   cos( (x+y) / z)
- the average of x, y and z

Your solution to this problem should be contained in a folder called lab_02_1.

## Exercise 2: Unit conversion (10 points)

Write a console program that converts meters into feet and inches.  The program starts by asking the user for a measurement in meters.  The program should accept a floating point number.  After getting the number, the program computes the number of feet and inches equal to the specified number of meters.  The program outputs feet and inches as whole numbers.  The program should round the number of inches correctly.  Test that your program produces the following outputs for the given inputs.

Input  | Output 
-------|----------
0.3049 | 1 ft 0 in 
1      | 3 ft 3 in 
2      | 6 ft 7 in 

Your solution to this problem should be contained in a folder called lab_02_2.

## Exercise 3: Random numbers (10 points)

Write a program that generates a list of 100 random integers. 

The C++ standard library contains a pseudo random number generator that you can use to solve this problem.  The function rand returns a pseudo random number.  To use rand in your programs, you need to include the cstdlib header as follows.

    #include <cstdlib>

The function rand will return the same sequence of values for a given seed.  You can change the sequence of values it returns by changing the seed as follows.

    srand(719);  // Seed the random number generator with 719.

The following is an example of how you can use the return value of rand.

    cout << rand();

You can vary the seed passed into srand by calling the time function.  Calling the time function with 0 as an argument results in the number of seconds from a given epoch (January 1, 1970 by convention).  The following code shows how to seed rand with this time.

    srand(time(0));

Use a for loop to generate the 100 list item entries required by this problem. 

You can save the program output by redirecting standard out to a file.  To do this, run the program as follows.

    ./a.out > numbers.txt

Open numbers.txt in text editor to see the result.

Your solution to this problem should be contained in a folder called lab_02_3.  Submit the file _numbers.txt_ along with you source code.  Do not submit _a.out_.
