## Instructions

Do the exercises described below; adhere to the organizational scheme used for the previous lab, changing numbers accordingly.  Commit your work into your source code repository.  Use your browser to verify that your files have been written into it.

## Exercise 1: Detecting prime numbers with functions (10 points)

Implement a function that takes an integer value and returns true if the integer is a prime number and false otherwise.  The function should have the following signature.

    bool is_prime(int n)

Use an assert statement inside the function to check the precondition that n is not negative.

Include the function in a console program that calls the is_prime function with a range of values that test several common cases as well as the boundary cases.  Use an assert statement for each test case.  For example, the following tests that the function returns false for the value 100.

    assert(!is_prime(100));

You need to include the cassert header in your code in order to use the assert function.

    #include <cassert>

Your solution to this problem should be contained in a folder called lab_04_1.

## Exercise 2: Listing prime numbers with functions (10 points)

In the previous lab, you wrote a console application that computes and displays all the prime numbers inclusively between 2 and a number entered by the user.  Write a program that has the same inputs and outputs as this previous exercise, but this time use the is_prime function you developed in the previous problem to simplify your code.  Specifically, replace the inner loop by a call to is_prime so that your new program uses a single loop inside the main function rather than a loop nested within another loop.

Your solution to this problem should be contained in a folder called lab_04_2.

## Exercise 3: Listing random colors with functions (10 points)

Re-organize the code in your solution to Listing random colors problem of the previous lab so that generation of a random color string is performed in a function.  Use functions to remove any nested loops (loops within loops) that are in your code.

Your solution to this problem should be contained in a folder called lab_04_3.
