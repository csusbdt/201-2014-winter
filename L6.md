<h1>Lab 6: Arrays</h1>

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to use vectors and arrays.
- Learn how to write algorithms that perform sequential (linear) processing.

## Instructions

Do the exercises described below; adhere to the organizational scheme used for the previous lab, changing numbers accordingly.  Commit your work into your source code repository.  Use your browser to verify that your files have been written into it.

## Exercise 1: Finding the maximum value (5 points)

<pre>
int mymaximum(int a[], int numberOfElements);
</pre>

Provide an implementation of the mymaximum function whose declaration is shown above.   The first argument of the function is an array of int and the second argument is the number of ints that are in the array.  The function returns the largest int that is in the array. 

Write test code that thoroughly tests the function.  The test code should use assertions.


## Exercise 2: Appending integers (5 points)

<pre>
void append(vector&lt;int> &amp; v, int n);
</pre>

Provide an implementation of the function whose declaration is shown above.   The first argument of the function is a vector of int and the second argument is the number of  consecutive integers to append to the vector starting from 0 and ending at <code>n - 1</code>.  The function appends onto the vector v the values 0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1.  (Hint: use the push_back function of vector to append these values to v.)  (5 points)

Write test code that thoroughly tests the function.  The test code should use assertions.


## Exercise 3: Appending vectors (5 points)

<pre>
void appendVector(vector&lt;int> &amp; v, const vector&lt;int> &amp; w);
</pre>

1) Provide an implementation of the appendVector function whose declaration is shown in  Figure 1.   Both arguments of the function are vectors of int.  The function should modify vector v by appending to it all the elements of w.  For example, if v = (4, 2, 5) and w = (11, 3), then after calling the function v will become (4, 2, 5, 11, 3).  Hint: the vector class has function called push_back that appends values.


## Exercise 4: Vector insertion (5 points)

Suppose a vector v contains a sequence of integers ordered from lowest to highest.  For example, v might contain the values 3, 6, 7, 12.  Write a function called insert that takes this vector v as a first argument and an integer k as the second argument.  The function inserts k into the vector so that it preserves the order of elements.  For example, if v were (3, 6, 7, 12) and k were 8, then after calling the function, v would be (3, 6, 7, 8, 12).  In your implementation of insert, do not use the insert function of the vector class (v.insert).

Write test code that thoroughly tests the function.  The test code should use assertions.


## Exercise 5: Counting occurrences (5 points)

<pre>
int countOccurrences(const vector&lt;int> &amp; v, int k);
</pre>

Implement the function countOccurrences whose declaration appears in Figure 2.  The first argument of the function is a vector v of integers and the second argument is an integer k.  The function returns the number of times k occurs in v.


## Exercise 6: Two-dimensional arrays (5 points)

<pre>
bool isAllZeros(int a[50][100]);
</pre>

Implement the function isAllZeros that uses a loop nested inside another loop to determine whether a 2-dimensional array contains only zeros.  A declaration of the function is shown above.  The array passed into the function will have 50 rows and 100 columns.
