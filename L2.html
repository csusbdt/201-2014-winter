</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
Create folder <em>~/201/lab_2</em> to contain 
the files that comprise
your solutions the problems in this lab.
</p>

<pre>
cd ~/201
mkdir lab_2
cd lab_2
pwd
</pre>

<p>
Each time you complete work on a source code file that
solve a problem in this lab,
add and commit it to your local repository
and then push this change to your remote repository.
</p>

<p>
Do not add <em>a.out</em>, back up files created by your editor, 
or other derived files to the repository
unless specifically asked for by the assignment.
Just add the source code files that you create,
which will all have a <em>.cpp</em> extension for this lab.
</p>

<p>
Make sure that you add, commit and push your files before the deadline.
</p>

<h3>Exercise 1:  Practice with mathematical expressions (10 points)</h3>

<p>
Write a console program that prompts the user 
for 3 double precision floating point values x, y and z.
Have the program compute and display the following values.
</p>

<ul>
<li>the sum of x, y and z</li>
<li>the sine of x</li>
<li>the cosine of x plus y divided by z<br>
    <em>cos((x + y) / z)</em>
</li>
<li>the average of x, y and z</li>
</ul>

<p>
Place your code in file <em>~/201/lab_2/ex1.cpp</em>.
</p>

<p>
After you complete writing, debugging and testing your code,
add and commit <em>ex1.cpp</em> to your local repository,
and then push this change to your remote repository.
The following commands accomplish this.
</p>

<pre>
cd ~/201/lab_2
git add ex1.cpp
git commit -m "lab 2 ex 1"
git push
</pre>

<h2>Exercise 2: Unit conversion (10 points)</h2>

<p>
Write a console program that converts meters into feet and inches.
The program starts by asking the user for a measurement in meters.
The program should accept a floating point number.
After getting the number, the program computes the number of feet and inches
equal to the specified number of meters.
The program outputs feet and inches as whole numbers.
The program should round the number of inches correctly.
Test that your program produces the following outputs for the given inputs.
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Input</th>
      <th>Output</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0.3049</td>
      <td>1 ft 0 in</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>3 ft 3 in</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>6 ft 7 in</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
Place your code in <em>~/201/lab_2/ex2.cpp</em>.
</p>

<p>
Add, commit and push.
</p>

<pre>
git add ex2.cpp
git commit -m "lab 2 ex 2"
git push
</pre>

<h2>Exercise 3: Random numbers (10 points)</h2>

<p>
Write a program that generates a list of 100 random integers. 
</p>

<p>
The C++ standard library contains a pseudo random number generator 
that you can use to solve this problem.
The function rand returns a pseudo random number.
To use rand in your programs, 
you need to include the cstdlib header as follows.
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;cstdlib>
</pre>

<p>
The function rand will return the same sequence of values for a given seed.
You can change the sequence of values it returns by changing the seed as follows.
</p>

<pre>
srand(719);  // Seed the random number generator with 719.
</pre>

<p>
The following is an example of how you can use the return value of <code>rand</code>.
</p>

<pre>
cout &lt;&lt; rand();
</pre>

<p>
You can vary the seed passed into <code>srand</code> by calling the time function.
Calling the time function with 0 as an argument 
produces the number of seconds from a given epoch 
(January 1, 1970 by convention).
The following code shows how to seed <code>rand</code> with this time.
</p>

<pre>
srand(time(0));
</pre>

<p>
Use a for loop to generate the 100 list item entries required by this problem. 
</p>

<p>
You can save the program output by redirecting standard out to a file.
To do this, run the program as follows.
</p>

<pre>
./a.out > numbers.txt
</pre>

<p>
Open <em>numbers.txt</em> in a text editor to see the result.
</p>

<p>
Submit the file <em>numbers.txt</em> 
along with your source code in a file named <em>ex3.cpp</em>. 
</p>

<pre>
git add ex3.cpp
git add numbers.txt
git commit -m "lab 2 ex 3"
git push
</pre>
