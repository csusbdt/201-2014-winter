<h1>Lab 7: Binary Search</h1>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Learn how to perform a binary search.</li>
<li>Understand the running time of binary search as a function of the vector size.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assignment Folder</h2>

<p>
Create folder <em>~/201/lab_7</em> to contain the files
you create for this lab.
Follow the same file naming convention
from earlier assignments.
Remember to add, commit and push your source code files after completing each exercise.
</p>

<h2>Exercise 1: Binary search (10 points)</h2>

<pre>
bool binarySearch(const vector&lt;int> &amp; v, int k);
</pre>

<p>
Write a function called <code>binarySearch</code> 
that finds an occurrence of an integer <code>k</code> 
in a vector <code>v</code> using binary search.
The function signature is given above. 
Write your own implementation of binary search;
do not use the search function available in the C++ standard library.
</p>

<p>
Binary search assumes that the sequence of values 
(stored in a vector in our case) 
is either non-decreasing or non-increasing.
Assume that the vector passed into <code>binarySearch</code> 
is non-decreasing, which means that each value beyond the first 
is either equal to or greater than the previous value.
</p>

<p>
Binary search is a natural search technique 
when the collection of items is stored in order.
It is roughly the technique you would use 
to look up the meaning of a word in a dictionary 
or find a phone number in a telephone book.
</p>

<p>
Write test code that thoroughly tests your function. 
Express your tests using assertions.
</p>

<h2>Exercise 2: Running time of binary search (10 points)</h2>

<p>
Binary search is much more efficient that linear search.
Imagine looking up a word in a dictionary by starting at page 1,
then looking at page 2, then page 3 and so on. 
For most words, the process takes significantly longer than a binary search. 
</p>

<p>
If there are <em>n</em> items in the vector, 
then in the worst case linear search will complete after <em>n</em> comparisons 
with the value you are searching for.
In contrast, binary search will complete after 
<em>log<sub>2</sub>n + 1</em> comparisons in the worst case, 
where <em>log<sub>2</sub>n</em> is the base 2 logarithm of <em>n</em>.
</p>

<p>
Add code to your implementation of the <code>contains</code> function 
that checks that the search completes within 
<em>log<sub>2</sub>n + 1</em> iterations of its processing loop.
Use the <code>assert</code> function to express this check as a requirement.
</p>

<p>
Note: The mathematical function <em>log<sub>2</sub></em> 
is available as <code>log2</code> if you include the header file &lt;cmath>.
