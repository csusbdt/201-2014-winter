<h1>Lab 7: Binary Search</h1>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Learn how to perform a binary search.</li>
<li>Understand the running time of binary search as a function of the vector size.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assignment Folder</h2>

<p>
Create folder <em>~/201/lab_7</em> to contain the files
you create for this lab.
Follow the same file naming convention
from earlier assignments.
</p>

<h2>Exercise 1: Binary search (10 points)</h2>

<pre>
bool contains(const vector&lt;int> &amp; v, int k);
</pre>

<p>
Write a function called <code>contains</code> 
that finds an occurrence of an integer <code>k</code> 
in a vector <code>v</code> using binary search.
The function signature is given above. 
Write your own implementation of binary search;
do not use the binary search function available in the C++ standard library through the algorithms header.
</p>

<p>
Binary search assumes that the sequence of values 
(stored in a vector in our case) 
is either non-decreasing or non-increasing.
Assume that the vector passed into <code>binarySearch</code> 
is non-decreasing, which means that each value beyond the first 
is either equal to or greater than the previous value.
</p>

<p>
Binary search is a natural search technique 
when the collection of items is stored in order.
It is roughly the technique you would use 
to look up the meaning of a word in a dictionary 
or find a phone number in a telephone book.
</p>

<p>
Write test code that thoroughly tests your function. 
Express your tests using assertions.
</p>

<h2>Exercise 2: Running time of binary search (10 points)</h2>

<p>
Binary search is much more efficient that linear search.
Imagine looking up a word in a dictionary by starting at page 1,
then looking at page 2, then page 3 and so on. 
For most words, the process takes significantly longer than a binary search. 
</p>

<p>
If there are <em>n</em> items in the vector, 
then in the worst case linear search will complete after <em>n</em> comparisons 
with the value you are searching for.
In contrast, binary search will complete after 
<em>log<sub>2</sub>n + 1</em> comparisons in the worst case, 
where <em>log<sub>2</sub>n</em> is the base 2 logarithm of <em>n</em>.
</p>

<p>
Add code to your implementation of the <code>contains</code> function 
that checks that the search completes within 
<em>log<sub>2</sub>n + 1</em> iterations of its processing loop.
Use the <code>assert</code> function to express this check as a requirement.
</p>

<p>
Note: The mathematical function <em>log<sub>2</sub></em> 
is available as <code>log2</code> if you include the header file &lt;cmath>.
