<h1>Lab 3: Algorithms</h1>

## Learning Objectives

- Learn about the boolean data type.
- Learn how to use conditional expressions (forms of the <code>if</code> statement).
- Learn how to compare integers, floating point numbers and strings.
- Learn how to write loops and use them to solve problems.
- Learn about nested branches and nested loops.

## Instructions

Do the exercises described below; adhere to the organizational scheme used for the previous lab, changing numbers accordingly.  Commit your work into your source code repository.  Use your browser to verify that your files have been written into it.

## Exercise 1:  Detecting prime numbers (10 points)

Write a console program that asks the user to enter a positive integer.  The program determines if the number entered is prime and writes a message to standard output stream stating whether the number is prime or not. For example, if the user enters 42, the program displays "42 is not prime."  If the user enters 47, the program displays "47 is prime."

Develop 8 test cases and verify that your program runs correctly for them.  The test cases should contain some prime numbers as well as non-prime values.

Include the test cases within a multi-line comment in your program.  Make sure the comment is nicely organized and easy to read and understand.

## Exercise 2: Listing prime numbers (10 points)

Write a console program that reads a positive integer entered by the user.  The program computes and displays all the prime numbers between 2 and the number entered.

To solve this problem, you need to nest an inner loop within an outer loop.

Develop test cases and include them in a multi-line comment.

Your solution to this problem should be contained in a folder called lab_03_2.

## Exercise 3:  Factoring numbers (10 points)

Write a console program that asks the user to enter a positive integer.  The program computes the prime factors of the number and prints them.  For example, if the user enters _100_, the program displays _2 2 5 5_.

Develop 8 test cases and verify that your program runs correctly for them.  The test cases should contain some prime numbers as well as non-prime values.

Include the test cases within a multi-line comment in your program.  Make sure the comment is nicely organized and easy to read and understand.

## Exercise 4: Generating random colors (10 points)

Write a program that generates a different list of 100 random RGB color values using hexadecimal notation.  The program should write something like the following into cout.

<pre>
324AF3
6A3125
... 98 additional RGB values
</pre>

To solve this problem you need to generate strings 
with 6 characters where each character
is randomly chosen from the following set of symbols

<blockquote>
{'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'}
</blockquote>

To make the choice random, you need to use the modulo operator (%).
Specifically, use the expression <code>rand()%16</code>
to get a random integer between 0 and 15.

You are required to solve this problem by defining a loop within a loop.
In fact, with the language features of C++ covered until this point, the solution to this problem requires a loop within a loop.  If you know how to solve the problem without a nested loop, then you are required to solved it with a nested loop anyway, because learning how to write nested loops is the main learning objective of this exercise.

The program should generate a different list of color values each times it runs.  To get this result, you need to seed the random number generator with a new value each time the program runs.  One easy way to do this is to use the current time in seconds as a seed value.  The following code shows how to do this.

<pre>
#include &nbsp;ctime>

...

main()
{
    srand(time(0));

...
</pre>
