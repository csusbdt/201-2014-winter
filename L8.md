<h1>Lab 8: Sorting</h1>

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to develop algorithms that solve computing problems.
- Learn about sorting algorithms.
- Learn about time complexity.

## Instructions

Do the exercises described below; adhere to the organizational scheme used for the previous lab, changing numbers accordingly.  Commit your work into your source code repository.  Use your browser to verify that your files have been written into it.

## Exercise 1: Sorting (10 points)

<pre>
void mysort(vector&lt;int> &amp; v);
</pre>

Write a function called _mysort_ that rearranges elements of a vector v so that they form an increasing sequence of values.  Allow for different vector positions to contain the same value.  Do not use a predefined sort routine from the standard library; develop your own sorting algorithm.

Implement a simple sorting algorithm rather than an efficient algorithm.

Write test code that thoroughly tests your function. Express your tests using assertions.

Your solution to this problem should be contained in a folder called lab_08_1.

## Exercise 2: Running time of sort (10 points)

There is a wide variety of sorting algorithms that have been discovered.  These algorithms can be divided into 2 types: ones that have worst-case running times that are proportional to n<sup>2</sup> and n*log(n), where n is the number of values being sorted.  The simple sorting algorithms have running times proportional to n<sup>2</sup>.  Sorting algorithms that have a running time proportional to n*log(n) are more complex.  In the previous exercise, you should have come up with a simple sorting algorithm.  In this exercise, you will add code that verifies this.

All sorting algorithms basically rely on a loop nested within another loop (or can be rewritten into this form).  Add code to your sorting algorithm that counts the number of times the instructions in the inner loop are executed. 

Write a test that creates different sized vectors of random integers and displays the number of times the inner loop runs for each array.  The following shows what the program might output.

<pre>
for n = 10 iterations = 78
for n = 100 iterations = 8752
for n = 1000 iterations = 603391
for n = 10000 iterations = 78123123
</pre>

Warning: the program may run slowly when processing a large number of values, so be patient.

The inner loop execution count is too large to fit into an int.  For this reason, you should declare this variable as type long.

<pre>
long innerLoopCount = 0;
</pre>

Theoretical analysis of the running time of algorithms is referred to as _time complexity analysis_.

Your solution to this problem should be contained in a folder called lab_08_2.
