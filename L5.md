## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to implement classes (user defined data types).
- Understand the concept of encapsulation (hiding internal details to make usage of a class more obvious).
- Understand how to implement and use accessor and mutator functions.
- Understand how to implement constructors.
- Understand how to overload member functions.
- Learn how to break the source code for a program into separate files (compilation units).
- Learn how to solve programming problems with classes.

## Instructions

Do the exercises described below; adhere to the organizational scheme used for the previous lab, changing numbers accordingly.  Commit your work into your source code repository.  Use your browser to verify that your files have been written into it.

## Exercise 1: A number class (10 points)

Develop a class called Number that represents an integer value.  The class should have a constructor that takes the integer value as its only argument.  The constructor should store this value in a private member variable.

Define a public member function called isPrime that takes no argument and returns a bool.  If the number is a prime number, then isPrime returns true, otherwise it returns false.

Define another member function called isDivisibleBy that takes a single integer argument and returns a bool.  If the integer passed into isDivisibleBy is a divisor for the number, then the function returns true, otherwise it returns false.

Test your implementation of the Number class using the following test code.

<pre>
#include &nbsp;iostream>
#include &nbsp;cassert>
#include "Number.h"

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
    Number nine(9);
    assert(!nine.isPrime());
    assert( nine.isDivisibleBy(1));
    assert(!nine.isDivisibleBy(2));
    assert( nine.isDivisibleBy(3));
    assert(!nine.isDivisibleBy(8));
    assert( nine.isDivisibleBy(9));

    Number seven(7);
    assert( seven.isPrime());
    assert( seven.isDivisibleBy(1));
    assert(!seven.isDivisibleBy(2));
    assert(!seven.isDivisibleBy(3));
    assert( seven.isDivisibleBy(7));

    Number seventySeven(77);
    assert(!seventySeven.isPrime());

    Number seventyThree(73);
    assert(seventyThree.isPrime());

    Number twentySeven(27);
    assert(!twentySeven.isPrime());
    assert(!twentySeven.isDivisibleBy(2));
    assert(twentySeven.isDivisibleBy(3));
    assert(twentySeven.isDivisibleBy(9));

    cout &nbsp;&nbsp; "All tests passed.\n";
    cin.get();  // Use if debugging program in Visual Studio.
}
</pre>

Your solution to this exercise should contain the following three files.

- main.cpp -- contains the test code given above
- Number.h -- contains the Number class declaration
- Number.cpp -- contains the implementation of the constructor and isPrime

Include a UML class diagram within a multi-line comment in Number.h.

## Exercise 2: Listing prime numbers with the number class (10 points)

In exercises from 2 previous labs, you developed programs that listed all the prime numbers between 2 and a number entered by the user.  In this exercise, you will write a program that also solves this problem; however, you should use the number class that you developed in the previous exercise of this lab.
