<h1>Lab 6: Arrays</h1>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Learn how to use vectors and arrays.</li>
<li>Learn how to write algorithms that perform sequential (linear) processing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assignment Folder</h2>

<p>
Create folder <em>~/201/lab_6</em> to contain the files
you create for this lab.
Follow the same file naming convention
from earlier assignments.
Remember to add, commit and push your source code files after completing each exercise.
</p>

<h2>Exercise 1: Finding the maximum value (5 points)</h2>

<pre>
int mymaximum(int a[], int numberOfElements);
</pre>

<p>
Provide an implementation of the <code>mymaximum</code> function 
whose declaration is shown above. 
The first argument of the function is an array of int 
and the second argument is the number of ints that are in the array.
The function returns the largest int that is in the array. 
</p>

<p>
Write test code that thoroughly tests the function.
The test code should use assertions.
</p>

<h2>Exercise 2: Appending integers (5 points)</h2>

<pre>
void append(vector&lt;int> &amp; v, int n);
</pre>

<p>
Provide an implementation of the function whose declaration is shown above.
The first argument of the function is a vector of int 
and the second argument is the number of consecutive integers 
to append to the vector starting from 0 and ending at <code>n - 1</code>.
The function appends onto the vector <code>v</code> the values 0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1.
(Hint: use the <code>push_back</code> function of <code>vector</code> 
to append these values to <code>v</code>.)  (5 points)
</p>

<p>
Write test code that thoroughly tests the function.
The test code should use assertions.
</p>

<h2>Exercise 3: Appending vectors (5 points)</h2>

<pre>
void appendVector(vector&lt;int> &amp; v, const vector&lt;int> &amp; w);
</pre>

<p>
Provide an implementation of the <code>appendVector</code> function
whose declaration is shown above.
Both arguments of the function are vectors of int.
The function should modify vector <code>v</code> 
by appending to it all the elements of <code>w</code>.
For example, if <em>v = (4, 2, 5)</em> 
and <em>w = (11, 3)</em>, 
then <code>v</code> will become <em>(4, 2, 5, 11, 3)</em>
as a result of calling the function.
Hint: the vector class has a function called <code>push_back</code> 
that appends values passed into it.
</p>

<h2>Exercise 4: Vector insertion (5 points)</h2>

<p>
Suppose a vector <code>v</code> contains a sequence of integers 
ordered from lowest to highest. 
For example, <code>v</code> might contain the values 3, 6, 7, 12.
Write a function called <code>insert</code> 
that takes this vector <code>v</code> 
as a first argument 
and an integer <code>k</code> as the second argument.
The function inserts <code>k</code> into the vector 
so that it preserves the order of elements.
For example, if <code>v</code> were (3, 6, 7, 12) 
and <code>k</code> were 8, 
then after calling the function, 
<code>v</code> would be (3, 6, 7, 8, 12).
In your implementation of <code>insert</code>, 
do not use the insert function of the vector class (v.insert).
</p>

<p>
Write test code that thoroughly tests the function.
The test code should use assertions.
</p>

<h2>Exercise 5: Counting occurrences (5 points)</h2>

<pre>
int countOccurrences(const vector&lt;int> &amp; v, int k);
</pre>

<p>
Implement the function <code>countOccurrences</code> 
whose declaration appears above.
The first argument of the function is a vector <code>v</code> of integers 
and the second argument is an integer <code>k</code>. 
The function returns the number of times <code>k</code> occurs in <code>v</code>.
</p>

<h2>Exercise 6: Two-dimensional arrays (5 points)</h2>

<pre>
bool isAllZeros(int a[50][100]);
</pre>

<p>
Implement the function <code>isAllZeros</code> 
that uses a loop nested inside another loop 
to determine whether a 2-dimensional array contains only zeros.
A declaration of the function is shown above.
The array passed into the function will have 50 rows and 100 columns.
