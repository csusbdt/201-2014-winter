<h1>Lab 7: Binary Search</h1>

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to perform a binary search.
- Understand the running time of binary search as a function of the vector size.

## Instructions

Do the exercises described below; adhere to the organizational scheme used for the previous lab, changing numbers accordingly.  Commit your work into your source code repository.  Use your browser to verify that your files have been written into it.

## Exercise 1: Binary search (10 points)

    bool contains(const vector<int> & v, int k);

Write a function called contains that finds an occurrence of an integer k in a vector v using binary search.  The function signature is given above.  Write your own implementation of binary search; do not use the binary search function available in the C++ standard library through the algorithms header.

Binary search assumes that the sequence of values (stored in a vector in our case) is either non-decreasing or non-increasing.  Assume that the vector passed into binarySearch is non-decreasing, which means that each value beyond the first is either equal to or greater than the previous value.

Binary search is a natural search technique when the collection of items is stored in order.  It is roughly the technique you would use to look up the meaning of a word in a dictionary or find a phone number in a telephone book.

Write test code that thoroughly tests your function. Express your tests using assertions.

## Exercise 2: Running time of binary search (10 points)

Binary search is much more efficient that linear search.  Imagine looking up a word in a dictionary by starting at page 1, then looking at page 2, then page 3 and so on.  For most words, the process takes significantly longer than a binary search. 

If there are n items in the vector, then in the worst case linear search will complete after n comparisons with the value you are searching for.  In contrast, binary search will complete after log<sub>2</sub>n + 1 comparisons in the worst case, where log<sub>2</sub>n is the base 2 logarithm of n.

Add code to your implementation of the contains a function that checks that the search completes within log<sub>2</sub>n + 1 iterations of its processing loop.  Use the assert function to express this check as a requirement.

Note: The mathematical function log<sub>2</sub> is available as __log2__ if you include the header file &lt;cmath>.
