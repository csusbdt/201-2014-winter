<h1>Lab 1: The Command Line</h1>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Learn how to work from the Linux command line.</li>
<li>Learn the difference between assembly language and C++.</li>
<li>Learn a simple approach to compile and run console programs written in C++.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>
To complete this lab, you need to have an account 
that enables you to log into the computers in JB 359.
The lab instructor will give you a username and password
or will explain how to get one. 
You can also log into computers in JB 358 with the same username and password.
</p>

<p>
You can optionally do all labs and assignments
from home or other remote location
by logging into a lab machine using SSH.
See <a href="ssh.html">How to work remotely using SSH</a>
for instructions on how to do this.
</p>

<p>
You can also work in an alternate environment
as described in the next section.
</p>

<h2>Alternative Environments</h2>

<p>
If you have a Mac that runs OS X, 
you can do this assignment on your computer
because the commands covered in this lab are also available in OS X.
However, you will need to install Xcode to have access to a C++ compiler.
</p>

<p>
If you have access to a computer that runs the Linux operating system,
then you can use that computer and do not need to work on a computer in JB 359/358.
You will need to install the GNU C++ compiler if not already installed.
How you do this depends on your system.
If you have a GUI-based package manager,
you can use that.
If your system uses <code>yum</code>, then run the following.
</p>

<pre>
yum install gcc-c++
</pre>

<p>
If your system uses <code>apt-get</code>, then run the following.
</p>

<pre>
apt-get install gcc-c++
</pre>

<p>
There are also other possible ways
to install the Gnu C++ compiler,
which are not covered here.
</p>

<p>
If your personal computer is fast enough and has enough memory,
you can run an instance of Linux in a virtual machine
such as <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtual Box</a>,
or you can set up your computer to dual boot into Windows or Linux.
</p>

<p>
As you can see, there are many ways to complete this and subsequent
assignments in this course.
It's up to you to decide.
If you're confused,
remember that the easiest way 
is to simply work in the labs (JB 358 or JB 359).
</p>

<h2>Learn How to Use a Text Editor</h2>

<p>
Log into a computer in JB 359 or other UNIX-based system
and practice creating files with one of the
text editors available on your system.
</p>

<p>
If you are working directly on a lab computer (not through SSH), 
then you can run programs that create windows, 
such as the text-editor called <em>gedit</em>. 
However, if you are working on a lab computer remotely (through SSH),
then you can not run programs that create windows, 
because the ssh program only gives you a text-based interface to the remote system.
In this case, you need to use a text editor
that runs inside a console window,
such as <em>vi</em> or <em>nano</em>.
</p>

<p class="callout">
A program that creates a window is said to have a graphical user interface (GUI).
In the early days of computers, GUIs did not exist,
so all interaction with the computer was through
character-based interfaces.
</p>

<p>
<em>Nano</em> is easier to understand than <em>vi</em>,
but <em>vi</em> is the traditional text editor that comes pre-installed
on practically all UNIX-like operating systems.
For this reason, <em>vi</em> is an important tool for system administrators.
</p>

<p class="callout">
If you want to work remotely but don't want to learn <em>vi</em>,
then use <em>nano</em> from the command line.
</p>

<h2>Learn the Command Line Interface</h2>

<p>
Use a search engine to find documentation and tutorials 
that help you understand the Linux command line interface.
(This is the same for OS X command line and other UNIX-based operating systems.)
</p>

<p>
Use your research skills to learn how to use the following Linux commands.
</p>

<pre>
pwd      # print working directory
cd       # change directory
ls       # list 
mkdir    # make directory
rmdir    # remove directory
mv       # move
cp       # copy
rm       # remove
</pre>

<p>
Also research how to use the following special characters in commands.
</p>

<pre>
.      # current directory
..     # parent directory
~      # home directory
</pre>

<p>
Log into a computer in JB 359 or other UNIX-based system
and practice using the above commands and special symbols.
</p>

<h2>Configure Your Environment to Use Git</h2>

<p>
The instructions in this section are for students working 
on a computer in JB 359, either locally or remotely (via SSH).
If you are working in a different environment, then see
<a href="https://github.com/csusbdt/centos/blob/master/GIT-SUBMISSION.md">the
general instructions for submitting work via Git</a>.
</p>

<p>
Look in your home folder for a hidden folder named <em>.ssh</em>.
</p>

<pre>
ls -a ~
</pre>

<p class="callout">
In UNIX-based operating systems,
files and folders that start with a dot are considered <em>hidden</em>.
To force these objects to be displayed with the <code>ls</code> command,
use the <code>-a</code> option.
</p>

<p>
If you do not find a .ssh folder, then run the following command
to generate a public-private key pair, which will also create the
.ssh folder to contain them.
<em>IMPORTANT: Do NOT enter a passphrase when the following command runs;
just press enter when asked for one (which it does several times).
Also, accept the default file name and location by simply pressing enter</em>.
Replace "Your name" with your name.
</p>

<pre>
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "Your name"
</pre>

<p>
After running this command, verify that the <em>.ssh</em> folder was created and
contains your private and public keys.
Your public key is stored in the following location.
</p>

<pre>
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
</pre>

<p>
Your private key is stored in the following location.
</p>

<pre>
~/.ssh/id_rsa
</pre>

<p>
You can distribute your public key, but keep your private key secret.
Other systems will use your public key to create a
cryptographic challenge that only the holder of the private key can solve.
This is called asymmetric key encryption and is the foundation for
secure communication on the Internet.
</p>

<p>
If you have a <em>.ssh</em> folder, 
but it does not contain file <em>id_rsa.pub</em>,
then you should run the <code>ssh-keygen</code> command given above 
to generate a public-private key pair.
</p>

<p>
Run the following command to load your keys into the SSH agent.
</p>

<pre>
ssh-add
</pre>

<p>
With the above configuration steps complete,
you should be able to use the <code>git</code>
program that is already installed on the computers in JB 359 (and 358).
</p>

<p>
I will set up a remote Git repository
for you to submit the source code you create for this course.
To do this, I need a copy of your ssh public key.
Use the following command to 
display a character representation of your public key.
</p>

<pre>
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
</pre>

<p>
Copy the contents of id_rsa.pub displayed on your screen
and paste into an email that you send to me at <em>dturner@csusb.edu</em>.
After I get your public key, I will create a repository for you
and reply to your email with a command that you should
use to clone your remote Git repository.
</p>

<h2>Experience Working with Assembly Language</h2>

<p>
Read <a href="cpu.html">What is a computer</a> 
and compile and run the assembly language program described in it.
</p>

<p>
Modify the source code in <em>hello.s</em> 
so that it displays <em>Hello, Alice.</em>
Test that your changes produce an executable
file that runs as expected.
</p>

<h2>Experience Working with C++</h2>

<p>
This section explains how to write, compile 
and run a simple C++ console program
from the Linux command line.
When the program runs, it prints <em>hello</em>.
</p>

<p>
Create a file named <em>hello.cpp</em>
with the following contents.
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char * args[])
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "hello\n";
}
</pre>

<p>
From a terminal window, run the following command 
to compile <em>hello.cpp</em>.
</p>

<pre>
c++ hello.cpp
</pre>

<p>
The above command generates an executable file named <em>a.out</em>.
This will overrite the <em>a.out</em> file that you generated
from <em>hello.s</em>.
To run this file, issue the following from the command line.
</p>

<pre>
./a.out
</pre>

<p>
Modify the source code in <em>hello.cpp</em> 
so that it displays <em>Hello, Alice.</em>
Test that your changes produce an executable
file that runs as expected.
</p>

<h2>Submit Your Work</h2>

<p>
Check your email for a git clone command that I will send to you.
When you get this email, run the command in your home directory
to clone this remote repository into you home directory.
</p>

<p>
The command I give you will create a folder named <em>201</em>
in your home directory.
This folder will contain a file name <em>README.md</em>.
Make sure you read this file and follow the instructions in it.
</p>

<p>
Create folder <em>~/201/lab_1</em>.
</p>

<pre>
mkdir ~/201/lab_1
</pre>

<p>
Copy your source code files into <em>~/201/lab_1</em>.
</p>

<pre>
cp hello.s ~/201/lab_1/
cp hello.cpp ~/201/lab_1/
</pre>

<p>
Add and commit these files into your local repository.
</p>

<pre>
cd ~/201/lab_1
git add hello.s
git add hello.cpp
git commit -m "lab 1"
</pre>

<p>
Push changes in your local repository to your remote repository.
</p>

<pre>
git push
</pre>

<p>
After pushing chnages to from your local repository to your remote repository,
send an email notification to
Gerren Willis at <em>willisg@coyote.csusb.edu</em>
and cc David Turner at <em>dturner@csusb.edu</em>.
Make sure you include your name and the name of the assignment (Lab 1) in the email message.
Do not attach any files to your email;
we will access your work from the remote Git repository.
</p>

<p>
Optionally study more about Git.
I recommend completing 
<a href="http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">the TryGit Tutorial at CodeSchool</a>.
After this, familiarize yourself with
<a href="http://git-scm.com/doc">the documentation for Git</a>
and <a href="http://git-scm.com/book">the Git Book</a>.
